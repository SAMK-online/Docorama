# Docorama - AI-Powered Document Editor

Welcome to **Docorama**, where we are transforming document creation and editing into a hands-free, voice-driven experience. This project is an innovative step towards making content creation seamless and efficient using state-of-the-art AI technology.

## Project Overview

Docorama is an AI-based document editor designed to simplify the process of writing and editing by using voice commands. The goal is to make content creation entirely verbal, providing a smooth, hands-free user experience. The following video demo you see was generated through our **Captions AI**, showcasing the power and efficiency of our technology.

## Key Features

- **AI-Driven Document Editing**  
  Utilizes **Eleven Labs** for speech-to-text conversion, allowing users to dictate content effortlessly. Leverages **OpenAI Whisper** for text-to-speech, enabling clear and natural audio playback.

- **Efficient In-Place Edits**  
  Employs **OpenAI predictive text** to make instant, in-place edits within the document, keeping changes quick and focused without rewriting the entire content.

- **Content Summarization and Script Generation**  
  Uses OpenAI to summarize the document and generate a script for Captions AI. Captions AI creates AI-driven content to serve as an engaging introduction to the document.

## How It Works

1. **Verbal Document Creation**: Users can dictate their documents, and the system transcribes the speech using Eleven Labs' speech-to-text capabilities.
2. **Hands-Free Editing**: Users can verbally command edits, and OpenAI's predictive features make precise modifications.
3. **Document Summarization**: Once the document is finalized, OpenAI summarizes the content, creating a script that Captions AI can use to generate video content.

## Technologies Used

- **Eleven Labs**: For high-quality speech-to-text conversion.
- **OpenAI Whisper**: For natural and accurate text-to-speech functionality.
- **OpenAI Predictive Text**: For efficient and intelligent in-place editing.
- **Captions AI**: For generating engaging AI-driven video content.

## Future Goals

We envision expanding Docorama's capabilities to include more AI-driven features and further enhance the user experience. Our mission is to make document editing and content creation as smooth and efficient as possible.
